  Mechanical keyboards, or keyboards with full, individual switches under every
  key, have exploded in popularity recently, although the technology inside is
  as old as the keyboard itself. There's really no substitute for that solid,
  clicking sensation under your fingers as you type, and the satisfying sound
  each key makes when you press it. However, choosing the best mechanical
  keyboard can be tricky, since there are dozens of models, different switch
  types, and more popping up every day. Here's how to tell them all apart and
  pick the right one for you.
